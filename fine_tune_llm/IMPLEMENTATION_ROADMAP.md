# Comprehensive Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap addresses five critical optimization areas for the LLM fine-tuning system:
1. **File and Directory Organization** - Streamline structure and eliminate redundancies
2. **Code Architecture** - Improve modularity, separation of concerns, and design patterns
3. **Consolidation** - Merge duplicate functionality and eliminate code redundancy
4. **Integration** - Ensure seamless component interaction and data flow
5. **Test Coverage** - Achieve comprehensive testing of all modules and integration points

## Current State Analysis

### 1. File and Directory Organization Issues

**Problems Identified:**
- `ui.py` at root level should be in scripts or dedicated UI folder
- Missing `train_lora_sft.py` script (referenced in CLAUDE.md but doesn't exist)
- Inconsistent naming: `infer_model.py` vs `infer.py` in voters/llm
- Test files scattered without clear organization by feature area
- Missing dedicated configuration validation modules
- No clear separation between core library and application scripts

**Optimization Needed:**
- Reorganize into clear functional modules
- Establish consistent naming conventions
- Create dedicated directories for UI components, configuration, and utilities
- Implement proper package structure with clear imports

### 2. Code Architecture Issues

**Problems Identified:**
- Circular import potential between modules
- Inconsistent error handling patterns across modules
- Missing abstract base classes for key interfaces
- No clear factory patterns for model/predictor instantiation
- Limited use of dependency injection
- Inconsistent configuration management

**Architecture Improvements Needed:**
- Implement proper interfaces and abstract base classes
- Add factory patterns for complex object creation
- Establish consistent error handling and logging
- Create configuration management system
- Implement proper dependency injection

### 3. Consolidation Opportunities

**Duplicate/Overlapping Functionality:**
- Multiple UI entry points (ui.py, dashboard launchers)
- Redundant model loading logic across scripts
- Duplicate configuration parsing in multiple files
- Similar evaluation metrics scattered across modules
- Overlapping inference logic in scripts and modules

**Consolidation Strategy:**
- Create unified configuration system
- Establish single model loading/management system
- Consolidate UI frameworks into coherent interface
- Merge evaluation and metrics functionality
- Create shared utility libraries

### 4. Integration Gaps

**Missing Integration Points:**
- Dashboard not integrated with live training process
- Risk prediction UI disconnected from actual model pipeline
- High-stakes audit system not integrated with training loop
- Configuration changes require manual script modifications
- No unified logging/monitoring across components

**Integration Requirements:**
- Real-time training-dashboard integration
- Unified configuration system across all components
- Centralized logging and monitoring
- Seamless data flow between all system components

### 5. Test Coverage Gaps

**Current Coverage Issues:**
- Missing integration tests between core modules
- No end-to-end pipeline testing
- Limited configuration testing
- Missing error condition testing
- No performance/load testing
- Incomplete mocking for external dependencies

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Unit tests for all modules (100% coverage target)
- Integration tests for all component interactions
- End-to-end pipeline tests
- Configuration validation tests
- Error handling and edge case tests
- Performance and resource usage tests
